*CompareML* is a comparator for machine learning algorithms libraries and services. It makes it easy for users to create a test model of their dataset in three of the most widespread options such as Scikit-Learn, Turi Graphlab and R libraries and, at the same time, allows selecting different well-known classification and regression algorithms available in all providers. 

The characteristics of *CompareML* facilitates data scientists the task of choosing the most suitable provider for their data, improving notably the experiment results while reducing time and costs. Furthermore, *CompareML* helps them in selecting the algorithms which are liable to produce the best results for their datasets.
